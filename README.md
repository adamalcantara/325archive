## Description

I've been a Beatles fan for as long as I can remember. Growing up during the release of The Beatles Anthology, I have a vivid memory of seeing John Lennon on TV playing his Rickenbacker 325. That indellible image has turned into a passion for the Rickenbacker 325 and its history. John's first Rickenbacker 325 was made in 1958, and website aims to chronicle those models.

The website is built using WordPress and a custom WordPress theme. It features static pages which discuss each of the Rickenbacker 325 models made in 1958 as well as their history, and it features a blog. The theme has security features, as well as internationalization so that certain aspects of it can be translated.

The biggest challenge of building this website was the page which displays the links to the pages for all of the 1958 Rickenbacker 325 models which are accounted for (pictured below). To create a page that would display other pages, I needed to use the WP_QUERY function which is built into WordPress, referencing the documentation to understand how to display the pages I wanted, in the order I wanted them. I also displayed the title of each page, along with an image from each page. Once I was able to accomplish this, I knew the vision I had for the website would be possible.

This website has not yet been deployed.
